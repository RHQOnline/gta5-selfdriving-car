# Self-Driving Cars: OpenCV and Python Integration
## A step in a new direction.
---
Built around the concept of a self-driving car. Built in Python and utilizing OpenCV integration, we're aiming to make a fool-proof self-driving car. This is also the first step in an up-and-coming pOCV project.

# About the Project
---
Initially, my interest was sparked when I heard all of the fuss surrounding a self-driving car in GTA5. This seemed like such a foreign and almost impossible task. Upon further looking into, I realized that although the project was online and kind of working, it was just running people over and ramming into walls repeatdly. I wanted to solve this and make it flow much more smoothly and efficiently, and hopefully within the lanes of the streets.
